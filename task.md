# Detailed Plan for Metrics Manager Improvements

This document outlines a step-by-step strategy for correctly computing the following metrics in `MetricsManager` without allowing block rotations:

1. **Best Fit Block**: Identify the block shape that clears the most lines when placed.
2. **Best Fit Place**: Record the exact `(row, column)` coordinates where that block achieves its maximum clear.
3. **Game Over Block**: Find a shape that cannot fit on the current board and will not fit on any optimally simulated future board after placing all preview blocks.
4. **Opportunity**: A boolean flag indicating the presence of a game-over block.

## Core Variables

### Configuration
```python
shapes: Dict[str, List[Tuple[int, int]]]  # All fixed block shapes from game config
```

### Board State
```python
board: Board  # Current game board instance
preview_blocks: List[Block]  # Upcoming blocks in preview/pool
```

### Best Fit Metrics
```python
best_fit_block: str  # Name of shape clearing most lines (default: "None")
best_fit_position: Tuple[int, int]  # (row, col) for best placement (default: (-1, -1))
max_lines_cleared: int  # Highest count of lines cleared (default: 0)
```

### Game Over Metrics
```python
game_over_block: str  # Name of shape causing game over (default: "None")
opportunity: bool  # True if game-over block exists (default: False)
```

### Simulation Variables
```python
future_boards: List[Board]  # Collection of possible future board states
```

## Helper Functions

### 1. Position & Placement Testing

```python
def can_place_anywhere(board: Board, block: Block) -> bool:
    """Check if block can be placed anywhere on the board."""

### 2. Game Over Block & Opportunity

```python

## Integration & Flow

### MetricsManager Method Implementation

```python
def update_game_state_metrics(self, board: Board, preview_blocks: List[Block]) -> None:
    """Update all game state metrics based on current board and preview."""
    
    # 1. Calculate occupancy, fragmentation, and danger metrics (existing code)
    filled_cells = sum(sum(row) for row in board.grid)
    total_cells = board.rows * board.cols
    self.occupancy_ratio = filled_cells / total_cells
    
    # Find empty clusters using BFS
    empty_clusters = self._find_empty_clusters(board)
    self.fragmentation_count = len(empty_clusters)
    
    # Calculate largest empty region
    if empty_clusters:
        largest_cluster_size = max(len(cluster) for cluster in empty_clusters)
        total_empty_cells = total_cells - filled_cells
        self.largest_empty_region = largest_cluster_size / max(1, total_empty_cells)
    else:
        self.largest_empty_region = 0.0
    
    # Calculate danger score (existing formula)
    inv_frag = 1.0 / max(1, self.fragmentation_count)
    inv_largest = 1.0 - self.largest_empty_region
    self.danger_score = (
        self.occupancy_weight * self.occupancy_ratio +
        self.fragmentation_weight * inv_frag +
        self.inv_largest_weight * inv_largest
    )
    
    # 2. Calculate best fit block and position
    shapes = self.config["shapes"]
    self.best_fit_block, self.best_fit_position, lines = compute_best_fit(shapes, board)
    
    # 3. Check for game over block and opportunity
    self.opportunity, self.game_over_block = find_game_over_block(shapes, board, preview_blocks)
    
    # 4. Update imminent threat based on current state
    self.imminent_threat = self._check_imminent_threat(board, preview_blocks)
```

---

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Unit Tests

```python
def test_best_fit_block():
    """Test best fit block calculation with various board states."""
    # Test cases:
    # 1. Empty board (should prefer highest position)
    # 2. Board with gaps that can be filled
    # 3. Board with multiple line clear possibilities
    # 4. Board with same line clear count but different heights
    # 5. Board where no lines can be cleared
    
def test_game_over_detection():
    """Test game over block and opportunity detection."""
    # Test cases:
    # 1. Block that doesn't fit now, but will fit after preview blocks
    # 2. Block that doesn't fit now and won't fit after any preview arrangement
    # 3. All blocks fit now and in future
    # 4. Empty preview (should use current board only)
    # 5. Block fits on some future boards but not others
```

### 2. Edge Cases

```python
def test_edge_cases():
    """Test edge cases and boundary conditions."""
    # 1. Nearly full board with only specific shapes fitting
    # 2. Empty board
    # 3. Board with only one possible placement spot
    # 4. Preview list is empty
    # 5. Every block can be placed now, but none after preview
```

### 3. Test Data Generation

```python
def generate_test_boards():
    """Generate test boards with known outcomes."""
    # 1. Board setup with known best fit
    # 2. Board with exactly one impossible block
    # 3. Board with multiple line clear options
    # 4. Board with no line clear options but multiple fit options
    # 5. Create test cases with known optimal/future placements
```

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Use early exit in can_place_anywhere when a valid position is found
   - Limit number of future boards generated to prevent combinatorial explosion
   - Consider caching results for repetitive calculations

2. **Accuracy Priorities**:
   - Best fit block must consider ALL possible shapes, not just preview blocks
   - Game over detection must check "can't place now AND can't place in future"
   - Multiple possible futures should be considered, not just optimal placements

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Handle empty preview list by checking only the current board
   - When no blocks can clear lines, select the highest placeable block
   - When no blocks can be placed anywhere, report "None" for best fit

4. **Future Extensibility**:
   - Design algorithms to handle potential changes in block behavior
   - Keep core metrics separate from display/reporting logic
   - Document assumptions about board and block behavior

**Important**: This is a planning document. Do not modify existing code until the plan is reviewed and approved.
